This is an analysed data of health care accessed in US in the past decade.\
This analysis should not be used in decision making or any sort as the data used is not comprehensive to inform any decision.

#### Comprehensive data set.

```{r}
Healthcare_dataset <- read.csv("healthcare_dataset.csv")
Healthcare_dataset
```

```{r}
# Data summary
summary(Healthcare_dataset)
print(summary)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
